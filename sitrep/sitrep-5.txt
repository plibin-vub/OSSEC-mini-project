Dear Professor Timmerman, Mr. Fayyad-Kazan,

This mail contains my fifth bi-weekly situation report for the OSSEC mini-project.

1. What did I do.

24/12/2013 (3.5h)
1. Finalize DRBD's setup
2. Test DRBD
3. Write down all my DRBD experiences
4. Create some movies to demonstrate the tests

24/12/2013 (3h)
1. Read about Ceph architecture.
2. Read about different ways to install Ceph.

27/12/2013 (7h)
1. Install virtual machines to test Ceph (3 cluster nodes, 1 admin node)
2. Install Ceph on admin node, on cluster nodes
3. Configure general cluster
4. Configure storage cluster with monitor
5. Write down all the steps in my report.
6. Test the object storage setup
7. Test adding an Object Storage Daemon (on the fly).
8. Create some video's with a demo of the setup.

27/12/2013 (3h)
1. Read about sharding for MySQL/Postgres.
2. Review different solutions.

27/12/2013 (1h)
1. Work on the Latex formatting of my report document.

02/01/2014 (2h)
1. Work on the latex document (references, formatting, images, â€¦).
2. Investigate video editing, to edit my example videos.
3. Investigate how I can include the videos in my presentation.

02/01/2014 (7h)
1. Read about sharding.
2. Setup a MySQL cluster environment (with 2 new virtual machines).
3. Install MySQL on the nodes and configure it properly so it can be accessed from another node.
4. Implement the sharded application (Java).
5. Test the sharded application on the MySQL cluster.
6. Write down all steps and remarks in my report.
7. Create a demonstration video.

03/01/2014 (2h)
1. Read about the wikipedia functionality and architecture.

In total I spent 28.5 hours on the project this period.

2. What will I do in the next period.
I will figure out an architecture that fits the needs of Wikipedia to be both scalable and provides high availability.
I will finalise my report and work on my presentation. 
I plan to spend 3 more full days on this (33hours) and I should be able to submit my report and presentation (draft) on 12/01/2014 (5 days before the exam on 17/01/2014).

3. Problems.
I had some problems to make Java connect to the MySQL server.
In the end, it seems that you have to provide a password (IDENTIFIED BY clause) when performing a GRANT ALL, if you omit this, the GRANT ALL will store the access rule without any password. My Java application was configured to use a password, so this did not work.
It took me some time to figure out what was wrong, but I think the final result of this experiment is nice.

4. Open issues.
At this moment there are no open issues.

5. Assistance
At this moment no assistance is required.

6. Other urgent matters
None.

Kind regards,

Pieter Libin
