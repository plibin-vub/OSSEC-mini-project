[OSSEC-Exam material] Submission of my exam materials

Dear Professor Timmerman, Mr. Fayyad-Kazan,

with this mail I want to submit my deliverables for the OSSEC exam:
the final report and a draft presentation.
The presentation already contains all content, but I still need to edit some of the videos (cropping, cutting out some obsolete parts) and finalise some of the images.
The presentation in attachment does not contain the actual videos (this made the presentation too large). Instead I added a YouTube-URL on every slide that will contain a video during my presentation on the exam.

I also added my last SITREP document to this email.

Can you please let me know whether you received all documents well?

Thanks in advance and kind regards,

Pieter Libin
