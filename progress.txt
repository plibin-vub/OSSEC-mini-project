1. Prepare a Latex document with Bibtex references.
2. Investigate which cluster monitoring tools exist and which ones are popular:
    - ganglia
    - nagios
   Describe these tools and mark their differences.
3. Investigate the concept of "Application performance monitoring"
   Identify some techniques how application can be monitored, tie these to ganglia.
   Investigate some scripts that can parse apache httpd log files to calculate the number of requests/second.
4. Summarise the topics I studied in the latex document.
5. Investigate load balancing.
   Identified HAProxy, read about the possibilities.

1. Read more about HAproxy, identified the possible usage scenario's and read the documentation to get an idea how to configure it.
2. Read about storage:
	database replication: master/slave, multi-master, sharding/NoSQL
	disk storage replication: DRBD, hardware RAID-1 
	file-based replication: rsync, unison, journaled file systems
3. Summarise the topics I studied in the latex document.
4. Study "distributed file systems": identify gluster as an interesting technology.
5. Start reading about sharding for MySQL and Postgresql

14/11/2013
1. Identify the different solutions to: make incremental database backups, make file system snapshots and to make incremental file system backups
2. Read about RDBMS database sharding, identify that this is possible for MySQL and Postgres. Read how this can be setup for MySQL.
3. Read about NoSQL, read how it can be useful to improve scalability. Identify some interesting solutions (MongoDB, CouchBase).
